# DE-NOISE

The codes perform the wavelet denoising process for time-series data. We adjusted the codes for microlensing time-series data, both
simulated ones and real events. 
The list of the real events discovered by the OGLE group can be found in realevent.txt 
(its columns determine the year, and the number of OGLE events). 

Two codes "cwt*.py" plot the 3D wavelet maps for a given time-series data by considering all kinds of continuous wavelets.  

Examples of denoised events are also attached.
